== Description ==

== Installation ==

1. Upload files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
  * Either [download the latest files](https://github.com/artcomventure/wordpress-plugin-OpenEMM/archive/master.zip) and extract zip (optionally rename folder)
  * ... or clone repository:
  ```
  $ cd /PATH/TO/WORDPRESS/wp-content/plugins/
  $ git clone https://github.com/artcomventure/wordpress-plugin-OpenEMM.git

  If you want a different folder name than `wordpress-plugin-OpenEMM` extend clone command by ` 'FOLDERNAME'` (replace the word `'FOLDERNAME'` by your chosen one):
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/artcomventure/wordpress-plugin-OpenEMM.git 'FOLDERNAME'
  ```
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. **Enjoy**

== Plugin Updates ==

Although the plugin is not _yet_ listed on https://wordpress.org/plugins/, you can use WordPress' update functionality to keep it in sync with the files from [GitHub](https://github.com/artcomventure/wordpress-plugin-slider).

**Please use for this our [WordPress Repository Updater](https://github.com/artcomventure/wordpress-plugin-repoUpdater)** with the settings:

* Repository URL: https://github.com/artcomventure/wordpress-plugin-OpenEMM/
* Subfolder (optionally, if you don't want/need the development files in your environment): build

_We test our plugin through its paces, but we advise you to take all safety precautions before the update. Just in case of the unexpected._
